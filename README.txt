-> This is a Flycatcher game. There is a picture of a flyswatter and a fly. The fly keeps moving around, so catching it will win you the game.
-> There is a timer set to 100 secs. Failure to catch the fly within the time, would make you lose the game.
-> Use BACKSPACE to shift between screens, (The lose screen may tell you to press enter, but please press backspace, because that's what was asked. I'm sorry, I didn't want to remove the image, cause I like it :))
-> Use Arrow keys to move the flyswatter
-> There as an easter egg to win the game without playing it. Try to find it without looking at the code please :)

-> ENJOY THE GAME!!!!!!!!!!
